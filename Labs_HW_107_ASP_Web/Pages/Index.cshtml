    Japan is one of the most popular travel destinations in the world. It is a unique blend of traditional and modern, with many temples and buildings from the past co-existing with modern achievements in architecture and technology. Visitors can be immersed in Japanese history and culture one day and get a glimpse of the future through technological developments the next. Almost all of the historical sites are still used for their original purposes while remaining open to the public. The natural beauty of Japan can be seen all year. In addition, Japan has one of the world’s lowest crime rates which makes it ideal for travelers.

    Japan Is famous for their amazing history, Mt Fuji, unrivaled technology and Samurais. Many of those seem to have been touched on already, but current day Japan is becoming famous for many other things as well like Anime, Sushi, Sumo and Cherry Blossoms. I actually wrote an article about it here.
    Anime
    Japan is responsible for creating anime with the earliest film dating back to 1917. However, anime didn’t become mainstream in Japan until the 1980’s but it quickly rose in popularity due to shows like Dragon Ball, and Gundam. Now its estimated at least over 1 billion people watch anime. As someone who has traveled all over Japan I can tell you that Anime is HUGE there!… look into Akihabara, the anime influence there is crazy.
    Sumo
    Sumo is full contact wrestling in which two competitors attempt to force each other out of a ring… but you probably already knew that.Sumo originated about 2,000 years ago. Like most bouts of physical fitness it was used as entertainment for the elite. Sumo has fluctuated in popularity over the years, but it remains a staple of Japanese culture and for that reason it is one of the many things that Japan is famous for.
    Sushi
    The people of Southeast Asia originally created sushi in order to preserve fish for long periods of time. However, the Japanese people are responsible for transforming the original process, refining it into the food that we know today. Sushi is savory, delicious and very convenient to eat. For those reasons sushi has spread across the world like wildfire over the past 40 years.
